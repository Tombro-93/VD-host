        <h1>Anitmated GIF</h1>
        <p>I wanted to create an animated gif that would act as a fun and engaging advertisement on social media. The purpose is to encourage web traffic to the Sprint website and create a customer base. The dimensions of the gif are 1,020px x 1,020px which is the standard size for social media platforms such as Instagram.</p>
        
        <img src="./assets/skate.gif"/>
        <ol>
          <li>I opened a new blank document in Photoshop and imported the skate board image which I sourced from Unsplash photos.</li>
          <li>To create my background I had to cut the legs and skateboard into their own layers using the selection and lasso tools.</li>
          <li>I used the patch tool to cover over where the leg originally was so that when it moved, the background remained consistent with the rest of the photo.</li>
          <li>Once I had done this, I added a colour filter of the brand colour #1d14fb and set it to 45% opacity to give it a blue finish.</li>
          <li>I the copied the kicking leg layer so that I had two of them which I could set into different positions to give the illusion of movement.</li>
          <li>I added another layer where I used the pen tool to create small illustrations around the feet to direct the users vision towards the shoes.</li>
          <li>I also added the white promotional text to its own layer and positioned it at the bottom of the square image.</li>
          <li>Once I had all my assets in the Photoshop file, I was ready to create my frame animation using the Timeline feature.</li>
          <li>I created two frames and turned off certain layers which I did not want to be visible in one frame, such as the animations and the leg position, then then switched these to be visible on the second frame.</li>
          <li>I set the speed of each frame to 0.5 seconds and set them on a forever loop so the gif would continue.</li>
          <li>Once I was satisfied with the motion sequence I exported the it for web as a dithered GIF with 256 colours to prevent the quality reducing too much.</li>
