        <h2>Image Portfolio</h2>
        <p> I wanted to create a range of imagery that could be used throughout the Sprint website so it is a cohesive experience for the user. I have selected the top six images which best demonstrate my technical editing skills, however, there are more graphics contained within the site.</p>

          <h3>Sprint logo</h3>
          <img src="./assets/Sprint-logo-01.png"/>
          <p>To begin, I developed a logo in Adobe Illustrator which captured the brands purpose alongside its playful nature. The final version is a trainer in motion over the ‘Sprint’ title pressing its weight into two of the letters. This provided a basis for shaping the brand and acted as a guide for the styling of the website and content which followed.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, I selected the brand font, ‘Poppins’, in bold italic to convey strength and speed.</li>
            <li>I then used the pen tool to draw the out line of a shoe in motion and filled this in with block colour.</li> 
            <li>I placed the shape above the ‘i’ and ’n’ in ‘Sprint’ text and the converted the text into shapes to allow me to edit them as shapes with the anchor tool. I created a groove in the text to give the impression of the foot.</li>
            <li>After I had placed the trainer in the text I added small lines behind the trainer to give the impression of movement. I changed the brush definition to make them less linear.</li> 
            <li>Finally, I used the brand colour XXXX to fill the entire logo shape. This can be changed to white to suit darker backgrounds. </li>
            <li>Web friendly?????</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Summer meltdown</h3>
          <img src="./assets/melt.jpg"/>
          <p>For this image I wanted to demonstrate my graphic skills and how I am able to manipulate text to grab attention and convey  strong brand image. I have created an effect to give the appearance that the text is melting into liquid to match the ‘melt’ reference.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>I began with plain text in Adobe Illustrator, “Summer Meltdown Sale”, and copied this three times. One in a blue colour, and the the other two in white.
            </li>
            <li>I then arranged these so the were vertically aligned and slightly overlapped. I connected them with the blend tool so the all merged into one another.</li>
          <li>Then I created outlines so the text became an editable shape. I used the warp function to drag and distort the letter shapes to give a melting illusion. </li>
          <li>I then copied this into Photoshop and used the Liquidise tool which elevated this further to make the text look as if it was dripping. 
          </li>
          <li>Finally I added a backdrop in the brand peach colour and exported it as a JPEG safe for web.</li>

        <p>This is another promotional image which I edited in the same way as the converse and running shoe images. I used the colour adjustment tools in Photoshop to remove the bright background and colours on the shoe and replaced them greys, whites and a peach colour so it is consistent with Sprint brand. I when added a navy background in Illustrator and used the pen tool to add the white illustration.
