        <h1>Image Portfolio</h1>
        <p> I wanted to create a range of imagery that could be used throughout the Sprint website so it is a cohesive experience for the user. I have selected the top six images which best demonstrate my technical editing skills, however, there are more graphics contained within the site.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-one">
          <h2>Sprint logo</h2>
          <img src="./assets/Sprint-logo-01.png"/>
          <p>To begin, I developed a logo in Adobe Illustrator which captured the brands purpose alongside its playful nature. The final version is a trainer in motion over the ‘Sprint’ title pressing its weight into two of the letters. This provided a basis for shaping the brand and acted as a guide for the styling of the website and content which followed.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, I selected the brand font, ‘Poppins’, in bold italic to convey strength and speed.</li>
            <li>I then used the pen tool to draw the out line of a shoe in motion and filled this in with block colour.</li> 
            <li>I placed the shape above the ‘i’ and ’n’ in ‘Sprint’ text and the converted the text into shapes to allow me to edit them as shapes with the anchor tool. I created a groove in the text to give the impression of the foot.</li>
            <li>After I had placed the trainer in the text I added small lines behind the trainer to give the impression of movement. I changed the brush definition to make them less linear.</li> 
            <li>Finally, I used the brand colour #1d14fb to fill the entire logo shape. This can be changed to white #FFFFFF to suit darker backgrounds. 
            </li>
            <li>I exported this to a PNG file to preserve transparency and allow this to be placed against different back grounds.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="image-three">
          <h2>Converse promotion image</h2>
          <div class="img3">
            <div class="con">
              <h4>Edit</h4>
          <img class="con" src="./assets/con-vedit-final-01.jpg"/>

          <img src="./assets/jaizer-capangpangan-Z8K5AiK7s04-unsplash.jpg"/>
        </div>
          </div>
          <p>I took the above image from Unsplash photos and manipulated it so that it was suitable for use as a promotional image hosted within the landing page of the website.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>I began in Photoshop using the crop tool to clean the edges and remove picture elements I didn’t want. </li>
            <li>I then used the levels adjustment tool and the colour balance tool to adjust the hues and remove any blue/cyan tones.</li> 
            <li>Then I selected the legs and shoes and added them to a new layer of their own where I used the selection tool to add an adjustment layer over the socks. I adjusted the hues so they went from yellow to peach in line with the Sprint brand colours.
            </li>
            <li>I added another adjustment layer over the background wall and added in a blue navy hue so that the colours were consistent with the brand but the wall texture remained.
            </li> 
            <li>I then used the pen tool add in the illustrated scribble so that it was associated with the brand style.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, I added in Poppins promotional text and exported the image as JPEG appropriate for the web.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="image-five">
          <h2>Summer meltdown</h2>
          <img src="./assets/melt.jpg"/>
          <p>For this image I wanted to demonstrate my graphic skills and how I am able to manipulate text to grab attention and convey  strong brand image. I have created an effect to give the appearance that the text is melting into liquid to match the ‘melt’ reference.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>I began with plain text in Adobe Illustrator, “Summer Meltdown Sale”, and copied this three times. One in a blue colour, and the the other two in white.
            </li>
            <li>I then arranged these so the were vertically aligned and slightly overlapped. I connected them with the blend tool so the all merged into one another.</li>
          <li>Then I created outlines so the text became an editable shape. I used the warp function to drag and distort the letter shapes to give a melting illusion. </li>
          <li>I then copied this into Photoshop and used the Liquidise tool which elevated this further to make the text look as if it was dripping. 
          </li>
          <li>Finally I added a backdrop in the brand peach colour and exported it as a JPEG safe for web.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
       
        <div class="image-six">
          <h2>Trail wear promotion image</h2>
          <div class="img6">
            <div clas="trail">
              <h4> Edit</h4>
          <img src="./assets/trailwear.jpg">
          </div>
          <div class="trail-2">
            <h4> Before</h4>
          <img src="./assets/trailwear 2.jpg"/>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>For this image, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to manipulate backgrounds and their pixels to increase the image size. The original image was 1,232px x 816px which I increased to a square that could be used a promotional image on the website and social media channels. 
        </p>
         <ol>
            <li>I started by using the patch tool in Photoshop to remove the small stones in the top corner of the image.</li>
            <li>Then I extended the Artboard so that it was square using the crop adjust tool. </li>
          <li>I used the free transform tool to fill in the new blank space with the grey concrete pixels from the top half of the original image. 
              </li>
          <li>Once I had enlarged the image background I was able to add in more shoes along the top of the image. I did this by selecting the bottom thee original shoes and copying them into a new layer.</li>
          <li>I the flipped these and dragged them to the top half go the page and adjusted the colours to give more variation. </li>
          <li> Finally, I used the pen tool to add in the illustration and the text tool to add in promotional text.</li>
          <li>I then exported this as a JPEG appropriate for web.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

          <h2>Sport navigation image</h2>
          <div class="img2">
            <div class="sport">
              <h4>Edit</h4>
          <img src="./assets/shoe-navy edit-01-01.jpg"/>

          </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>I chose this image to act as a way finder and a navigational element of the website. By clicking this image it will take you to the sport section of the website. I manipulated this so that it was no longer a bright yellow sports shoe with a race track background. 
            </p>
          <ol>
            <li>I opened the file which I sourced on Unsplash photos in Adobe Photoshop. I then used the levels adjustment layer to ensure the tonal range was appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>I decided to slightly clean up the appearance of the shoes sole and remove small dirt marks with the spot healing brush tool.
            </li> 
            <li>I then added an adjustment layer to alter the yellows on the shoe to orange using the colour adjustment.</li>
            <li>I then switched off the background layer and exported the image as a PNG so the background was transparent. </li> 
            <li>I opened the new PNG in Adobe Illustrator. Here I added a new plain navy background to match the colour scheme of the overall website and some promotional text with the text tool. 
            </li>
            <li>As a finishing touch, I added in a plain white illustration line using the pen tool with anchor points. This gives an illustrated interaction with the product and makes it more appealing for users. I exported this as a JPEG appropriate for use on the web.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="image-four">

          </div>
          <p>This is another navigational image which I edited in a similar the way to the running shoe image above. 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, I used the colour balance tool and hue adjustments to edit the converse colour in Photoshop.</li>
            <li>I then used the quick selection and lasso tools to cut it into its own layer. </li> 
            <li>I switched off the background layer and cropped the Artboard so it was just the size of the shoe layer.
            </li>
            <li>Then I exported it as a PNG so the background was transparent and could be opened in Illustrator. 
            </li> 
            <li>Finally, I added in the plain background and brand illustrations as well as the label text. </li>
            <li>This was exported as a JPEG suitable for web. </li>
